            <h2>Bombay to San Diego</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am a junior at UC San Diego studying Computer Science. I am originally from 
               Bombay, India and came to the United States after completing high school in India.
               I am currently part of UCSD's research team that is involved in the International 
               Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM), which is the premiere undergraduate
               Synthetic Biology competition. I was involved in mostly the front-end aspects of the web application (SBiDer) that we built this summer. As of now, we're in the process preparing a presentation & poster for our team for the the 2014 iGEM conference in Boston 2 weeks from now.</p>

            <h2>Research Project, Summer '14</h2>
            <p>I was lucky enough to be part of the team reprsenting UC San Diego at <a href = "http://igem.org/About">iGEM</a> (International Genetically Engineered Machine competition) 2014, the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition hosted by MiT. With little to no experience in Biology, I was involved in the web development process for the most part. I worked closely with two other team-mates throughout summer, & together we developed the website, the application (SBiDer) & the <a href = "http://2014.igem.org/Team:UCSD_Software">wiki</a>. <br><br>Here's the project abstract from our wiki:<br><br>
            "Genetic circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. SBiDer, a web tool developed by the UCSD Software iGEM team, will leverage existing devices to construct a database with consideration for the function of each device interpreted as boolean logic. The data can be queried by the user through SBiDer's visual interface to explore circuit designs. Users can search for existing circuits that can be used to assemble a complex circuit. The displayed circuit's literature reference, characterization data, and images of included devices can be viewed through the built-in table. We also provide a standalone modelling Python package that can be used to model circuits given by our online webtool. SBiDer's web of information can be expanded through user-generated additions to the database to improve the efficiency of the application and the accuracy of the models. "

			<h3>About us</h3>
			<p> We are a team of highly motivated undergraduate students and PhD candidates. 
                            We are trying to build an online application for visualizing the network of synthetic
                            genetic circuits. This could prove to be a super handy application for researchers around the world.
